# PHP To-Do App  

**Yes, I already know what you’re going to say...**  
“Bruh, PHP? In 2025??”  

But have you *actually tried it*?  
No? Thought so. Sit down, grab some popcorn, and let me show you that PHP still has a few tricks up its sleeve.  

##  What is this?  
A simple **To-Do List App** built with PHP.  
Because nothing says “productivity” like reinventing the wheel in a language that refuses to die.  

##  Features  
-  Add tasks (because Post-its are overrated)  
-  Mark tasks as done (feels more satisfying than crossing them out with a pen, trust me)  
-  Delete tasks (so you can pretend you were never procrastinating in the first place)  

##  Tech Stack  
- PHP (yes, still alive)  
- MySQL (because you can’t just store tasks in your diary)  
- HTML/CSS (keeping it simple, unlike my life choices)  

##  How to Run  
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Import the included SQL file into your MySQL database.  
3. Point your local server (XAMPP/LAMP/whatever) to the project folder.  
4. Open in your browser.  
5. Add tasks. Delete tasks. Judge yourself silently.  

##  Why PHP though?  
Because sometimes you just want to build something without wrestling with 400 dependencies, 15 build tools, and a framework that gets deprecated before you finish reading the docs.  

##  Final Thoughts  
This isn’t the fanciest To-Do app in the world.  
It won’t make you rich.  
It won’t impress that one friend who only speaks in JavaScript frameworks.  

But hey — it works.  
And in the end, isn’t that what we all want?
